        <h2>The Election Handbook</h2>
        <p>The Election Handbook is providing a guide to voting during the pandemic. This is a stressful time for everyone, so make sure you know how to vote before casting your ballot. You have the power to make your voice heard.</p>

    <h2>What has changed?</h2>
    <p>During the pandemic, because of the potential of viral spread amongst the community, our methods of voting are evolving to adapt to these unusual circumstances. Despite all of the talk about "voting-by-mail," most states also are still providing in-person polling sites. However, we encourage you to vote by mail if you can, in order to stop the spread of communicable disease whilst still making your voice heard.</p>

    <h2 id="misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>Some skeptics of the practice of voting-by-mail claim that the practice encourages voter fraud, but there is <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mail-fraud-myths-facts-and-how-to-vote-by-mail-or-absentee/">no evidence</a> of that being the truth. The president has been one of these skeptics, partly on the basis that he believes it will hurt his political pursuits. However, there is <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/neutral-partisan-effects-vote-mail-evidence-county-level-roll-outs">evidence</a> against that as Stanford researchers found that "vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party's vote share." Voting by mail is absolutely a safe and secure way to cast your ballot.</p>
    <p>Another common misconception is that mail-in votes will not be counted unless the election is closely contested. This is absolutely false. Every ballot, including absentee and in-person ballots, are counted <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Outreach-Materials/FVAP_MythReality.pdf">equally</a>.</p>
    <p>A third common misconception is that you always have to have an excuse to vote by mail. While in <a href="/handbook/voterguide/">some states</a> this may be true, it is not true in most states in this election cycle. Because of the pandemic, most states are changing their vote-by-mail rules to allow everyone to vote by mail, without an excuse.</p>

    <h2>Voting by mail</h2>
    <p>The above map shows the current status of voting by mail. The policy in each state generally falls into four broad categories: the green represents states that (a) require no excuse to vote by mail, and (b) automatically send ballots to all <a href="/handbook/voterguide/">registered</a> voters. The blue represents states that (a) require no excuse to vote by mail, and (b) automatically send applications to all registered voters to request a mail-in ballot. The orange represents states that (a) require no excuse to vote by mail, and (b) require registered voters to request an application to request a mail-in ballot. Finally, the red represents states that (a) require an excuse to vote by mail, and (b) require registered voters to request an application to request a mail-in ballot.</p>
