  <h2>Reminder</h2>
  <p>Remember, as a citizen of the United States, you are entitled to vote in free and fair elections. Do not let anyone prevent you from voting at your polling place, and make sure you <a href="/transparency">know the laws</a> of your state before going to vote or voting by mail.</p>

<div class="card">
	<h2>What are the laws?</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <strong>Voters may not:</strong>
      <li>Cast a vote in the name of someone who has passed away.</li>
      <li>Cast a vote in the name of someone who has moved.</li>
      <li>Intentionally vote twice.</li>

Find out which states with our <a href="/handbook/voterguide">2020 voter guide</a> or <a href="/transparency">Election Transparency Index</a>.</li>
      <strong>These laws apply to all voters, including you.</strong>
    </ul>

You must first register to vote, and some states also require photo ID and notaries for mail-in ballots.
