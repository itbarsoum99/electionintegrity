<h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h2>
<p><strong>Biden</strong> <a href="https://joebiden.com/beat-covid19/">says</a> that he would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement widespread testing-and-tracing, by setting up a pandemic testing board to guarantee regular, reliable, and free access to testing for all, double the number of drive-through testing sites, and build a national contact tracing workforce.</li>
<li>Establish a sustainable PPE supply chain by utilizing the Defense Production Act, replenishing depleted supplies in hard-hit areas and "build now toward a future, flexible American-sourced and manufactured capability to ensure we are not vulnerable to supply chain disruptions in times of crisis."</li>
<li>Accelerate a coordinated global approach for a safe and effective vaccine by increasing manufacturing of candidates, protecting research from cyberattacks, proactively building a nationwide vaccine campaign, restoring our relationship with the WHO, and building a clinical trial network to bring scientific talent together.</li>
<li>Create a stronger, more effective reopening by delivering a clear, consistent message on mask-wearing, increasing testing and contact tracing, guaranteeing COVID-19 paid leave, setting an emergency temporary standard for employers, equipping businesses with COVID-19 certifications and a "restart package," and assisting schools with re-opening.</li>
<li>Protect older Americans by ensuring evidence-based guidance is provided, creating more testing capacity so that visitors can be accommodated, and boosting Social Security payments to ensure that people on fixed incomes can "weather the long arc of the pandemic."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf">issued</a> "Coronavirus Guidelines for America" in March, which suggested preventative measures. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you or someone in your household is sick, stay home and keep them home.</li>
<li>If you are an older person, stay home.</li>
<li>If you have underlying health conditions, stay home.</li>
<li>Listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.</li>
<li>Engage in work and school from home whenever possible.</li>
<li>Follow CDC guidelines in the workplace.</li>
<li>Avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people.</li>
<li>Avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts.</li>
<li>Avoid discretionary travel.</li>
<li>Do not visit nursing homes or retirement communities.</li>
<li>Practice good hygiene by washing your hands, avoiding touching your face, sneezing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow, and disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>These guidelines do not include to wear a mask, the scientific consensus on which was reached after they were released. The president has imposed no mandates on any of these guidelines, though states have imposed mandates for some or all of them.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change">Climate Change</h2>
<p><strong>Biden’s</strong> <a href="https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/">plan</a> for Climate Change includes making far-reaching investments in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure: Create millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure – from roads and bridges to green spaces and water systems to electricity grids and universal broadband – to lay a new foundation for sustainable growth, compete in the global economy, withstand the impacts of climate change, and improve public health, including access to clean air and clean water.</li>
<li>Auto Industry: Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century; and invest in U.S. auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union.</li>
<li>Transit: Provide every American city with 100,000 or more residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments with strong labor protections that create good, union jobs and meet the needs of these cities – ranging from light rail networks to improving existing transit and bus lines to installing infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.</li>
<li>Power Sector: Move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.</li>
<li>Buildings: Upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes over 4 years, creating at least 1 million good-paying jobs with a choice to join a union; and also spur the building retrofit and efficient-appliance manufacturing supply chain by funding direct cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows, which will cut residential energy bills.</li>
<li>Housing: Spur the construction of 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units.</li>
<li>Innovation: Drive dramatic cost reductions in critical clean energy technologies, including battery storage, negative emissions technologies, the next generation of building materials, renewable hydrogen, and advanced nuclear – and rapidly commercialize them, ensuring that those new technologies are made in America.</li>
<li>Agriculture and Conservation: Create jobs in climate-smart agriculture, resilience, and conservation, including 250,000 jobs plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines – providing good work with a choice to join or continue membership in a union in hard-hit communities, including rural communities, reducing leakage of toxins, and preventing local environmental damage.</li>
<li>Environmental Justice: Ensure that environmental justice is a key consideration in where, how, and with whom we build – creating good, union, middle-class jobs in communities left behind, righting wrongs in communities that bear the brunt of pollution, and lifting up the best ideas from across our great nation – rural, urban, and tribal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trump</strong> has <a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/?searchbox=%22The+concept+of+global+warming+was+created+by+and+for+the+Chinese+in+order+to+make+U.S.+manufacturing+non-competitive.%22">declared</a> that global warming was created "by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." However, it is the overwhelming scientific <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-real/">consensus</a> that global warming is real. Trump’s policies, however, don’t reflect this. According to the New York Times, during his administration, nearly 100 climate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html">rollbacks</a> have occurred, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left the Paris Climate Agreement in which all signatories pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>Weakened fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for some cars and trucks.</li>
<li>Replaced the Clean Power Plan, which set strict limits on carbon emissions from coal and gas power plants, with a version that lets states set their own rules.</li>
<li>Eliminated a requirement for oil and gas companies to report methane emissions.</li>
<li>Eliminated a rule designed to limit toxic emissions from major industrial polluters.</li>
<li>Eliminated an Obama executive order that set a 40% greenhouse gas reduction goal for the federal government.</li>
<li>Creating a plan to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil and gas development.</li>
<li>Replaced an executive order that preserved major waters with a policy focused on energy production and economic growth.</li>
<li>Reduced the environmental review process for federal infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Scaled back pollution protections for certain tributaries and wetlands.</li>
<li>Rejected a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities in children.</li>
<li>Ended payments to the Green Climate Fund, a UN program to help poorer countries reduce carbon emissions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<p><strong>Biden</strong> has <a href="https://joebiden.com/healthcare/">proposed</a> protecting and building on the ACA, through these vital steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving every American access to affordable insurance with a public option system like Medicare, increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums, and expanding coverage to low-income Americans.</li>
<li>Providing peace of mind with a less complex system, including a new, more affordable option, a premium tax credit for middle-class families, the end of surprise medical billing, using antitrust authority to end healthcare market concentration, and lowering costs by partnering with the health care workforce.</li>
<li>Standing up to abuse of power by pharma companies by repealing the Medicare exception that allows drug corporations to avoid negotiating with Medicare, limiting launch prices for drugs that have no competition, limiting price increases for drugs to inflation allowing patients to buy prescription drugs from other countries ending pharma tax breaks, and improving the supply of quality generics.</li>
<li>Ensuring healthcare is a right for all by expanding access to abortion through restoring funding for Planned Parenthood and reversing the assault on the right to choose; reducing high maternal mortality rate; defending healthcare protections for all; doubling America’s investment in community health centers; and expanding access to mental health care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trump</strong>, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-supreme-court-overturn-affordable-care-act/">fighting</a> to end the Affordable Care Act, an action that could cause 20 million Americans to lose their health coverage. In his <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/america-first-health-care/">plan</a>, Trump says that he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has taken numerous actions to increase choice and competition in health care to bring down costs, through expanding the use of short-term, limited-duration plans, which offer more choices to consumers; expanding access to Association Health Plans to make it easier for small businesses to band together to offer better insurance; and to expand health reimbursement arrangements for employers.</li>
<li>Has taken actions to dismantle Obamacare, which has lowered Obamacare premiums, through tax cuts, which repealed the individual mandate; and through repealing the independent payment advisory board. He says that "over the last two years, premiums for Obamacare plans are declining for the first time."
</li>
<li>Is working to protect the most vulnerable in our healthcare system, including being committed to protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions; giving terminally ill patients "hope and the ability to try new experimental drugs"; signing the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, investing millions for child cancer research; and taking action to expand the availability of organ donations.</li>
<li>Is working to set ambitious healthcare goals, including putting forward principles to stop surprise billing; and setting a goal to<br />
end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US within a decade.</li>
<li>Is fighting to bring down drug prices by approving record numbers of generic drugs; introducing new principles for reducing prescription drug costs; signing legislation to improve drug pricing transparency; eliminating kickbacks to help Medicare recipients; working to allow the importation of cheaper drugs from other countries; and helping lower-income Americans gain access to life-saving medications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-economy">The Economy</h2>
<p><strong>Biden’s</strong> "Build Back Better" <a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">plan</a> outlines his plan for rebuilding the economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobilize American manufacturing and innovation to "ensure that the future is made in America, and in all of America," through building a strong industrial base and small-business-led supply chains to retain and create millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing and technology.</li>
<li>Mobilize American ingenuity to "build a modern infrastructure and an equitable, clean energy future" through investing in modern, sustainable infrastructure; meeting the climate crisis; building a clean energy economy; addressing environmental justice; and creating millions of good-paying union jobs.</li>
<li>Mobilize American talent and heart to build a 21st-century caregiving and education workforce to help ease the burden of care for working parents through making it easier to afford child care; ensuring aging relatives and people with disabilities have better access to care; to elevate pay and benefits for caregivers and educators; to and to create millions of good-paying new union jobs in these areas.</li>
<li>Mobilize to advance racial equity in America by closing the racial wealth gap, expanding affordable housing, investing in minority entrepreneurs and communities, advancing criminal justice reform, and promise educational opportunity "regardless of race or zip code."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trump’s</strong> policy focuses on reducing the trade deficit, eliminating the national debt, and cutting taxes. According to the president, his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/historic-results-president-donald-j-trumps-economic-agenda/">record</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real GDP growth that has beaten the Congressional Budget Office’s projections every year.</li>
<li>Adding 5 million new jobs than the CBO projected prior to the 2016 election.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate is 1.4 percentage points lower than the CBO’s projection.</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers, however, were published four days before the major economic crash due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Current numbers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm">the BLS</a>, all but three states in the country have hit their historical high in unemployment rates in 2020.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/">unemployment rate</a> is 7.9% nationally.</li>
<li>The GDP <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product">shrunk</a> by 31.4% in the second quarter of 2020, after a 5% decrease in the first quarter; two subsequent quarters of GDP decrease means that the US is officially in an economic recession.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two candidates had a dispute over the economy in the first presidential debate, with Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/trump-touts-v-shaped-economic-recovery-while-biden-sees-it-k-shaped.html">saying</a> that the US was in the midst of a V-shaped economic recovery, while Biden said it was K-shaped, with gains going overwhelmingly to the rich.</p>
