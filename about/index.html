    <h2>How the Program Works</h2>
    <p>The 2020 program, which will consist of five one-hour sessions, in which the students and the instructor will
      discuss political issues, political involvement, and fact-checking. We will help the student develop their own
      political beliefs free of partisan bias and influence. Our goal is not to influence the minds of the next
        generation, but to help them cultivate their own beliefs.</p>
