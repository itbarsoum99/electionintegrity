      <h2>Welcome to the Election Integrity Project!</h2>
      <p>It is more crucial than ever that <u>all eligible adults go out and vote</u>. Our project is dedicated to upholding election integrity, educating citizens on voting, and providing materials to help you register and vote. Don't say you don't do politics. Say you <em>do</em> politics and vote this November.</p>
