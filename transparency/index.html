    <h2 class="state">Election Transparency Index</h2>
    <p>The Election Transparency Index is based on transparency of statistics, mail-in voting, ease of voter
      registration/election, and photo ID laws. The index takes the average of scores from all four of these categories
      and converts it into a letter grade for the state. Our <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18FKi_ytaH_4EbJuY2cA2lerFOAWd6WXvJy27zvkhwvg/edit?usp=sharing">data</a>
      comes from sources including individual states' Secretary of State websites, <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/vote-by-mail-states/">The Washington Post</a>, and
      <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/2020-voting-guide.html">Slate's voting guide</a> for 2020.
      The scores are intended to be unbiased reflections of the transparency of the election in each US state.</p>
